## Part 1: Install Anaconda (Python + Jupyter)

### What is Anaconda?
Anaconda installs **Python** (the programming language) and **Jupyter Notebook** (where you'll write code) together. It also includes 300+ data libraries so you don't need to install anything else.

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### Windows Users

1. **Download the installer**
   - Go to: [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   - Click the blue **"Download"** button (it should automatically detect Windows)
   - If asked: Choose **64-bit Graphical Installer** (≈600 MB)

2. **Run the installer**
   - Find the file in your Downloads folder (named `Anaconda3-...-Windows-x86_64.exe`)
   - **Double-click** to run
   - Click **"Yes"** if Windows asks for permission

3. **Installation wizard (follow exactly)**
   - Click **"Next"** (don't change anything)
   - Click **"I Agree"** (license agreement)
   - **"Install for: Just Me"** → Next
   - **Destination folder:** Leave as default (`C:\Users\YourName\anaconda3`) → Next
   - **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says **"Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable"** (it's red text – check it anyway)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Check the box that says **"Register Anaconda as my default Python"**
   - Click **"Install"** (takes 5-10 minutes – coffee break)

4. **After installation**
   - Click **"Next"** (skip Microsoft VSCode installation – not needed)
   - Click **"Next"** (skip PyCharm – not needed)
   - Click **"Finish"**

5. **Verify installation**
   - Press `Windows` key, type `Anaconda Navigator`
   - Click the app icon – it should open a window (may take 30 seconds first time)
   - You should see a screen with "Jupyter Notebook", "Anaconda Prompt", etc.

#### Mac Users

1. **Determine your Mac type**
   - Click the Apple logo (top-left) → "About This Mac"
   - Look at **"Chip"**:
     - **Apple M1, M2, or M3** → You need "Apple Silicon" version
     - **Intel** → You need "Intel" version

2. **Download the installer**
   - Go to: [anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   - Click **"Download"** – choose the correct version for your chip
   - File will be in Downloads folder (named `Anaconda3-...-MacOSX-...sh`)

3. **Run the installer**
   - Double-click the `.pkg` file (not the `.sh` file if both appear)
   - Click **"Continue"** through the screens
   - Click **"Agree"** to license
   - **"Install for: All users"** or **"Just me"** – either works
   - Click **"Install"** (may ask for your computer password)
   - Wait 5-10 minutes

4. **Verify installation**
   - Open **Finder** → **Applications** → **Anaconda Navigator**
   - Double-click to launch (may say "first time opening")
   - You should see the Anaconda Navigator window

#### Linux Users

```bash
# Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
# Download the installer
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Run the installer
bash Anaconda3-2024.10-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Follow prompts:
# - Press Enter to scroll through license
# - Type "yes" to agree
# - Press Enter for default install location
# - Type "yes" to run conda init

# Close and reopen terminal, then verify
conda --version
```

### Common Anaconda Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Anaconda Navigator won't open" | Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and type: `anaconda-navigator` |
| "Add to PATH" option didn't appear (Windows) | Reinstall – uncheck and recheck the box. It's critical. |
| "Disk full" error | Free up 5 GB space. Delete old downloads, empty trash. |
| Mac: "can't be opened because Apple cannot check it" | Right-click the installer → Open → Click "Open" again |

### How to Ask for Help (Important!)

When stuck, **don't** say: "It doesn't work"  
**Do** say:
```
Problem: When I run `print(x)`, I get "NameError: name 'x' is not defined"

What I tried: I defined x = 5 in the cell above

Screenshot: [paste image]
```

**Post in `#python-help`** – instructor or peers will reply within 4 hours.

## Still Stuck? (Read This Before Panicking)

### "I followed all steps but Jupyter won't open"

**Try this:** Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) and type:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Copy the URL that appears (starts with `http://localhost:8888`) and paste into Chrome.

### "I can't find the Anaconda download page"

Direct links (if the website is confusing):
- **Windows 64-bit:** [Click here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-Windows-x86_64.exe)
- **Mac Intel:** [Click here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)
- **Mac Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):** [Click here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.10-MacOSX-arm64.pkg)

### "My Tableau dashboard won't save"

Tableau Public saves to the cloud, not your computer. Look for **"Save to Tableau Public As..."** in File menu, not "Save As".

### "GitHub Desktop says 'No repositories found'"

You need to fork first (step in Part 4). Go to the course repo in your browser and click "Fork" before cloning.

### "I missed the Slack invite"

Email the instructor (instructor@youracademy.com) with "Slack invite" in the subject line.
