# Week 3: Visualization + Tableau

**Week starting:** [Date]  
**Live lecture:** Tuesday 7–9 PM ET  
**Live lab:** Thursday 7–8 PM ET  
**Office hours:** Saturday 11 AM–12 PM ET

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Create professional charts in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Customize colors, labels, and figure sizes for presentations
- Connect Tableau Public to CSV files
- Build interactive bar charts, line charts, and maps in Tableau
- Create a multi-page dashboard with filters and actions
- Publish and share interactive dashboards online

**Real-world application:** You'll transform your cleaned data from Week 2 into a shareable executive dashboard – the exact deliverable expected of junior analysts.

---

## Why Visualization Matters

Raw numbers don't persuade stakeholders. Charts do. 

**This week bridges the gap:** Python for exploration (quick, flexible) + Tableau for presentation (interactive, shareable).

## Week 3 Schedule (Detailed)

### Tuesday: Live Lecture – Python Visualization (2 hours)

**Part 1: Matplotlib Fundamentals (1 hour)**
- Why Matplotlib? The foundation of Python plotting
- Creating figures: `plt.figure()`
- Basic plots: `plt.plot()`, `plt.bar()`, `plt.scatter()`, `plt.hist()`
- Customization: titles, labels, legends, colors, grids
- Subplots: multiple charts in one figure

**Part 2: Seaborn for Statistical Plots (1 hour)**
- Why Seaborn? Beautiful defaults + statistical insight
- `sns.barplot()` with error bars (confidence intervals)
- `sns.histplot()` for distributions
- `sns.scatterplot()` with color mapping
- `sns.pairplot()` for exploring multiple variables
- Combining Matplotlib and Seaborn

**Live coding demo:** Load `cleaned_orders.csv`, create 4 different charts showing sales trends, profit by region, and distribution of order values.

**Recording available:** Within 2 hours after session.

**Slides:** `slides_python.pdf` in this folder.

---

### Thursday: Live Lab – Tableau Dashboarding (1 hour)

## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Python Charts from Cleaned Data (`python_plots/exercises/exercise1_charts_from_cleaned_data.ipynb`)
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ (Easy-Medium)  
**Time:** 60–75 minutes

**Scenario:** You cleaned `messy_orders.csv` in Week 2. Now your manager wants 4 charts to understand sales and profit patterns.

**Tasks:**

**Chart 1: Bar Chart – Total Profit by Region**
- Use Seaborn: `sns.barplot(data=df, x='region', y='profit', estimator=sum)`
- Add title: "Total Profit by Region"
- Color: Blue for positive profit, red for negative

**Chart 2: Histogram – Distribution of Order Values**
- Use Matplotlib: `plt.hist(df['sales'], bins=20)`
- Add vertical line at median sales value
- Label axes: "Sales Amount ($)", "Number of Orders"

**Chart 3: Scatter Plot – Sales vs Profit**
- Use Seaborn: `sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='sales', y='profit', hue='region')`
- Add a horizontal line at y=0 (profit/loss threshold)
- Title: "Sales vs Profit by Region"

**Chart 4: Line Chart – Profit Over Time**
- First, convert `order_date` to datetime: `pd.to_datetime()`
- Group by week: `df.resample('W', on='order_date')['profit'].sum()`
- Plot as line with markers
- Add rolling 2-week average as dashed line

**Deliverable:** Completed notebook with all 4 charts, each in its own cell with a 1-sentence interpretation below.

**Bonus:** Create a single figure with 4 subplots (2x2 grid) showing all charts together.

## Tableau Reference Guide

### Key Concepts (First 30 Minutes)

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Dimension | Categorical data (blue) | Region, Category, Date |
| Measure | Numeric data (green) | Sales, Profit, Quantity |
| Sheet | Individual chart or table | Bar chart, line chart |
| Dashboard | Container for multiple sheets | Executive Summary page |
| Filter | Limits data shown | Region = "North" only |
| Calculated Field | New column from formula | Profit Margin = SUM(Profit)/SUM(Sales) |

### Tableau Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut (Windows) | Shortcut (Mac) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| New sheet | Ctrl + M | Cmd + M |
| New dashboard | Ctrl + Shift + D | Cmd + Shift + D |
| Undo | Ctrl + Z | Cmd + Z |
| Show/Hide cards | Ctrl + 1,2,3,4 | Cmd + 1,2,3,4 |
| Add filter | Right-click dimension → Show Filter | Same |
| Swap rows/cols | Ctrl + W | Cmd + W |

### Dashboard Design Tips (From Real Analysts)

**Do:**
- Use 3-5 sheets per dashboard max (cognitive load)
- Place filters at top or left
- Use consistent colors (e.g., blue = sales, green = profit)
- Add a title and date range context
- Test on a small screen (laptop) – if you have to scroll, it's too wide

**Don't:**
- Use pie charts with >5 categories
- Use red/green alone (colorblind users – add patterns or labels)
- Add every field as a filter (users get overwhelmed)
- Forget to publish (others can't see local work)

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

### Python Plotting

**❌ Mistake 1:** Forgetting `plt.show()` in scripts
```python
# Works in Jupyter, fails in .py file
plt.bar(x, y)  # No output!

# Always add
plt.bar(x, y)
plt.show()  # Forces display
```

**❌ Mistake 2:** Plotting dates without converting
```python
# Wrong (treats dates as strings)
plt.plot(df['order_date'], df['profit'])

# Correct
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])
plt.plot(df['order_date'], df['profit'])
```

**❌ Mistake 3:** Overlapping subplots
```python
# Wrong (second plot overwrites first)
plt.plot(x1, y1)
plt.plot(x2, y2)
plt.show()

# Correct (subplots or separate cells)
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
ax1.plot(x1, y1)
ax2.plot(x2, y2)
```

### Tableau

**❌ Mistake 1:** Can't find your CSV
- **Fix:** Tableau Public only reads local files. Save CSV to Desktop, reconnect if moved.

**❌ Mistake 2:** Dashboard filters don't work
- **Fix:** Click filter → "Apply to Worksheets" → "Selected Worksheets" → Check which sheets should update.

**❌ Mistake 3:** Map shows "unknown" for regions
- **Fix:** Tableau doesn't know "North" as a location. Use generated latitude/longitude or rename regions to actual city/state names.

**❌ Mistake 4:** Can't save locally
- **Fix:** Tableau Public saves to cloud only. Click "Save to Tableau Public As..." → log in → publish.

## Dataset Details

### Using Your Week 2 Outputs

You'll use two files from Week 2:

**`cleaned_orders.csv`** (1,200 rows, cleaned)
- `order_id`, `order_date`, `region`, `category`, `customer_segment`
- `sales`, `profit`, `quantity`

**`region_summary.csv`** (4 rows – one per region)
- `region`, `total_sales`, `average_profit`, `order_count`

**Where to find them:** 
- If you completed Week 2 exercises, they're in `week2-pandas/exercises/`
- If lost, re-download from `week3-visualization-tableau/python_plots/data/`

## Help & Troubleshooting

### Python Plotting Issues

**"My plot is tiny and unreadable"**
```python
# Set figure size at beginning
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
# Or for Seaborn
sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(12,6)})
```

**"Chinese/missing characters in labels"**
```python
# Add this for Mac/Windows
plt.rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Arial']
```

**"Seaborn says 'No module named seaborn'"**
```bash
conda install seaborn -y
# Or
pip install seaborn
```

**"My dates show as 1970-01-01"**
```python
# Convert to datetime first
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'], errors='coerce')
# Drop rows where conversion failed
df = df.dropna(subset=['order_date'])
```

### Tableau Issues

**"Tableau Public won't open my CSV"**
- Check file is not open in Excel (close Excel first)
- Save CSV as UTF-8 encoding (in Pandas: `df.to_csv('file.csv', encoding='utf-8')`)

**"My map shows dots, not regions"**
- Tableau needs latitude/longitude. Use:
  - If you have city/state names: Assign geographic role
  - If only region names: Use symbol map, not filled map

**"Dashboard is slow to load"**
- Reduce data: Filter to last 3 months
- Use extracts instead of live connections (Data → Extract)

**"Can't publish – 'Tableau Public limit reached'"**
- Free account limit: 10 workbooks. Delete old ones at public.tableau.com

### Still stuck?
1. **Slack:** Post in `#python-help` or `#tableau-help` with:
   - Error message (copy-paste)
   - Screenshot of your code or Tableau view
   - What you already tried
2. **GitHub Issue:** Use the template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
3. **Office hours:** Saturday 11 AM ET – share your screen
