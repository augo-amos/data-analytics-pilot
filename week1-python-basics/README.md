# Week 1: Python Fundamentals for Data

**Week starting:** [Date]  
**Live lecture:** Tuesday 7–9 PM ET  
**Live lab:** Thursday 7–8 PM ET  
**Office hours:** Saturday 11 AM–12 PM ET

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Set up and navigate Jupyter Notebook for data analysis
- Write basic Python code using variables, lists, loops, and functions
- Read and process a simple CSV file without external libraries
- Debug common syntax errors independently
- Understand why Python is the #1 language for data careers

**Real-world application:** You'll write a script that reads a sales CSV and calculates total revenue – the foundation of every data analyst's workflow.

---

## Why Python First?

Many bootcamps start with Excel or SQL. We start with Python because:

1. **Python forces you to think logically** (Excel hides the logic in cells)
2. **Python scales** (100 rows or 100 million rows – same code)
3. **Python is free** (no license fees ever)
4. **Python leads to ML & AI** (you can't do machine learning in Excel)

> "The first week is the hardest. By Friday, you'll wonder why you were ever nervous."

# Then use it on data from sample_sales.csv

def calculate_total(sales_list):
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    pass

# Your function should work with: calculate_total([10, 20, 30]) -> 60

## Python Reference Card (Keep This Open)

### Variables & Data Types

| Concept | Code | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Integer | `x = 10` | Whole number |
| Float | `price = 19.99` | Decimal number |
| String | `name = "Data"` | Text in quotes |
| Boolean | `is_valid = True` | True/False |
| Check type | `type(x)` | Returns `int`, `str`, etc. |

### Lists

| Operation | Code | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Create list | `items = [1, 2, 3]` | |
| First item | `items[0]` | Returns `1` |
| Last item | `items[-1]` | Returns `3` |
| Add item | `items.append(4)` | List becomes `[1,2,3,4]` |
| Remove item | `items.remove(2)` | Removes first `2` |
| Length | `len(items)` | Returns `4` |
| Slice | `items[1:3]` | Returns `[2,3]` |

### Loops

| Type | Code | Use when |
|------|------|----------|
| For loop (list) | `for item in my_list:` | Iterate through items |
| For loop (range) | `for i in range(5):` | Repeat N times (0-4) |
| While loop | `while x < 10:` | Unknown number of iterations |

### Conditionals

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `if x > 10:` | Greater than |
| `if x < 10:` | Less than |
| `if x == 10:` | Equal to (NOTE: double equals) |
| `if x != 10:` | Not equal to |
| `if x >= 10:` | Greater than or equal |
| `elif x == 5:` | Else if |
| `else:` | Otherwise |

**Common mistake:** `=` is assignment, `==` is comparison
```python
# Wrong (assigns 10 to x, always True)
if x = 10:

# Correct (checks if x equals 10)
if x == 10:
```

### Functions

| Concept | Code |
|---------|------|
| Define function | `def my_function(param1, param2):` |
| Return value | `return result` |
| Call function | `output = my_function(5, 10)` |

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate):
    discounted = price * (1 - discount_rate)
    return discounted

final_price = calculate_discount(100, 0.2)  # Returns 80.0
```

### Reading CSV Files

```python
import csv

with open('data/sample_sales.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    header = next(reader)  # Skip first row
    for row in reader:
        product = row[0]
        quantity = int(row[1])
        price = float(row[2])
        print(f"{product}: ${quantity * price}")
```

---

## Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them

### ❌ Mistake 1: Indentation Errors
```python
# Wrong (missing indent)
for price in prices:
print(price)

# Correct (indented 4 spaces)
for price in prices:
    print(price)
```
**Fix:** In Jupyter, press Tab after the colon. Use 4 spaces consistently.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using `=` instead of `==`
```python
# Wrong (assigns value, doesn't compare)
if price = 100:

# Correct (compares)
if price == 100:
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: Forgetting to convert types
```python
# Wrong (string + integer)
quantity = "5"
total = quantity + 10  # Error!

# Correct (convert string to int)
quantity = int("5")
total = quantity + 10  # Works: 15
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Off-by-one in loops
```python
# Wrong (stops at 4, never prints 5)
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i)  # Prints 1,2,3,4

# Correct (prints 1 through 5)
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: Modifying list while looping
```python
# Wrong (skips items)
for item in my_list:
    if item < 0:
        my_list.remove(item)

# Correct (loop over copy)
for item in my_list[:]:  # [:] creates a copy
    if item < 0:
        my_list.remove(item)
```

## Success Checklist (End of Week)

By Sunday night, you should have:

- [ ] Watched Tuesday lecture (live or recording)
- [ ] Attended Thursday lab (or watched recording)
- [ ] Completed `exercise1_variables_loops.ipynb`
- [ ] Completed `exercise2_functions_csv.ipynb`
- [ ] Exported `total_revenue.txt` (from Exercise 2)
- [ ] Pushed both notebooks to your GitHub fork
- [ ] Posted `week1-done` in Slack with a screenshot of your revenue output

**If all checkboxes are checked:** You're ready for Week 2 (Pandas).

---

## Help & Troubleshooting

### "Jupyter won't launch"
**Fix:** 
- Windows: Open Anaconda Prompt, type `jupyter notebook`
- Mac: Open Terminal, type `jupyter notebook`
- If that fails: Reinstall Anaconda

### "NameError: name 'x' is not defined"
**Fix:** You're using a variable before creating it. Check spelling and order of code cells.

### "FileNotFoundError"
**Fix:** Your notebook is in the wrong folder. Use:
```python
import os
print(os.getcwd())  # Shows current directory
```
Then adjust path: `'../data/sample_sales.csv'` (two dots means "go up one folder")

### "IndentationError: unexpected indent"
**Fix:** Mix of tabs and spaces. In Jupyter: Edit → Select All → Format → Untabify Region.

### "TypeError: can only concatenate str to str"
**Fix:** You're adding string to number. Convert: `int(my_string)` or `str(my_number)`

### Still stuck?
1. **Slack:** Post in `#python-help` with:
   - Error message (copy-paste exactly)
   - Your code (paste as text, not screenshot)
   - What you expected to happen
2. **GitHub Issue:** Use the template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
3. **Office hours:** Saturday 11 AM ET – bring your questions

## Preview: How Week 1 Connects to Week 2

In **Week 2**, you'll learn Pandas – a library that automates everything you did manually this week:
- Reading CSV files becomes `pd.read_csv()` (one line)
- Calculating totals becomes `df['sales'].sum()` (one line)
- No more loops over rows (Pandas does it in C speed)

**But Week 1 matters because:** Understanding loops and variables helps you debug when Pandas does something unexpected.
