# Syllabus: Foundations of Data Analytics (Pilot Program)

**Academy:** Daystar Analytics Lab  
**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Weekly commitment:** 5–6 hours  
**Format:** Live online + recorded + hands-on projects  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public, GitHub

---

## Course Overview

This pilot program introduces the core workflow of a data analyst: from cleaning raw data in Python to building interactive dashboards in Tableau. You'll complete one real-world project that you can add to your portfolio.

**This is a pilot** – your feedback will shape the full program. By the end, you'll know if a career in data is right for you, without investing in a full-length course.
